 2.Find the heavier among 8 identical balls in weighing ?
 
 explanation:suppose the balls are numbered 1 to 8,the best way is weighing 3 balls one side and other 3 balls on other side of weighing,here there are 2 possibilities
 a.if the weights on weighing are  equal,then heavier ball is in the remaining 2 balls and can be found by weighing remaining balls again so answer in this case is 2 trials.
 b.if the weights  on weighing are not equal,suppose 4,5,6 has heavier ball(the answer might be 4 or 5 or 6). to figure out which one it is, weigh any two against each other - say, 4 vs. 5. If one or the other is heavier, than you've found your answer. If the weighing balances, then you know the heavy ball is 6. Again, solved in two trials.
 
 Ans:2 trials
